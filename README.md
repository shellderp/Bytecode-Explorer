Bytecode Explorer
=================

Bytecode Explorer is a graphical tool that loads Java classes and provides an interface for bytecode exploration.
Many features are similar to what most Java IDE's offer (reference searching, etc.). This project started as result of needing better tools for reverse engineering Java applications.

Features
--------

* load .class files, .jar files, or specify directories to load all .jar, .class files
* class hierarchy organized by inheritance or package structure
* find references to methods, fields (eventually classes, constants, libraries)
* go to super declaration
