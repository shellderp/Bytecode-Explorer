MAIN FUNCTIONALITY:
[ ] constantpool instruction context menu: go to declaration and all respective menu items (e.g. find references)
    - for a method call, have a menu for the class, as well as the method
[ ] classes can be loaded as orphans (no superclass loaded). keep in a list and link to parents if parentclass is loaded
[ ] find all references to a class (rather than to a specific member) either from class hierarchy or a class tab
[ ] class/field/method name refactoring
[ ] context menu for classes: find in tree, find references, unload
[ ] search loaded classes - for classnames, methodnames, fieldnames, constants, more?
    - can have a search for class member by modifiers/name

[ ] search in open class - not sure what criteria to use
     - can use same search as above but allow scope to be either all loaded classes or currently open class
[ ] handle overrides in reference search
   - 3 scenarios:
    - target/baseclass has a method m which a subclass s does not override, in this case show all references to m invoked on s
    - target/baseclass has a method m which a subclass s overrides, in this case do not show references to m invoked on s
    - target has a method m which is an overriden method from baseclass b; in this case, try to determine if a reference to b.m == a.m
[ ] decompiled view
[ ] save modified classes to jar
    - can keep track of where each file came from, then "save to respective jars" or "save all to single jar"
     - make a list of all files that didn't come from jars and prompt for jar name
    - also have option to save all files to wherever they came from, and possibly for only modified files
     - "save all classes to original files" "save only modified classes to original files"
     - this will also allow unloading files by their source
[ ] annotation - highlighting, making notes in classes, allow hotlinking to members
    - can do bookmarks similarly
[ ] docking frames
[x] go to super declaration
[x] replace ref searching with a function that calls back to each reference, or minimum returns a list rather than nodes


CONVENIENCE:
[x] merge loading jars & directories. select any files and auto load. if directory, load all jars in directory as well as classes
[x] add option to load additional classes ontop of the existing tree
[x] group constant pool entries by type
[ ] option to display tree by package instead of inheritance
[ ] show class file location on disk
[ ] create new class
[ ] modify method/field access modifiers, type
[ ] show local var info (+ other code attributes?)
[ ] session storing and loading
[ ] button to locate the current open tab with class hierarchy tree, and one to autosync when changing tabs, similar to eclipse double arrows
[ ] back/forward to navigate between locations
[ ] toggle between fully qualified names and simple class names, possibly per location (i.e. only for reference tab)
    - have a Name class that provides the chosen name style
[ ] type-first-letters-to-find classes, methods, fields
[x] expand all nodes when creating trees
[ ] option to order methods,fields by modifiers, alphabetical, type
[ ] use icons for methods,fields to reflect modifiers

timeless:
[ ] move slow things off swing thread to a threadpool e.g. reference searching
[ ] confirm before exiting (only for unsaved changes)
[ ] settings dialog
